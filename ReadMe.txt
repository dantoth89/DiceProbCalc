This is a decision support dice calculator for GW made war games.
My main goal with it was to practice the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology.

It goes through the attack sequence with the given parameters.
To hit rolls -> to wound rolls -> save rolls.

In the end it gives you the average wound that the given parameters should do.
In the real life the dice rolls can give you very different results some times, but
it gives you the idea of the probable outcome.
